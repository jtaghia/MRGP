# Conditionally independent multiresolution Gaussian process

This is an implementation of the conditionally independent multiresolution Gaussian process (ciMRGP) model based on Taghia and Schön (2019). Unlike the common assumption of full independence, ciMRGP assumes conditional independence among Gaussian processes (GPs) across all resolution.
